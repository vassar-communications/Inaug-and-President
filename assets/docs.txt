buildkit-template
=================

This serves as a template for your new site. It is meant to be populated with your own styles, and overwritten. Do NOT upgrade by replacing this with a new, fresh copy of buildkit-template.

This is essentially the part of your styling that is specific to your site design. buildkit-core contains stuff that is generic; buildkit-template contains your design.

Rename this folder to "assets" when using it for a project.


structure
---------

 - Sections define specific parts of a site that require their own styling: one page (like the homepage), or an entire section (like a Wordpress blog). A section folder does not need its own distinct _modules folder. All section-specific modules should be contained in the section folder itself. The master styling for that section lives in a "_style" file.
